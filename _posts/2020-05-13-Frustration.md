Every so often, when I'm alone, I get struck by a strong urge to be creative, this is to the point where I almost feel uncomfortable.

I don't like this feeling.

I say that for a reason, I've grown to not enjoy this feeling and that fact annoys me. I should be able to think "Oh I'm feeling creative, I'll work on a project or put some time into something that satisfies that itch" but the fact is I can never quite find something.

Whenever I try to get started on something that feels like it's going to satisfy that itch I usually feel overwhelmed, I'll get stuck on a problem and quickly demotivated, often because it's the end of a day at work and I'm tired and my brain just feels slow. The itch doesn't go away, so I end up bouncing around doing nothing in particular until the feeling eventually goes away.

It's depressing to acknowledge this habit, another uncomfortable feeling, it's even more unpleasant to have the thought that I'm publishing it on a public platform, but the hope that there's someone else around who has the same feeling raises my spirits. Please, if you do have the same burning desire to do something, to produce something, have you conquered it?

This feeling, when it arrives, fills up my life, quite literally often as I'll end up cloning random projects or even trying to start new ones. I'm writing this now purely as a vent to direct this odd energy somewhere so it doesn't feel botled up, compressed within me to a near painful degree, like a near upset stomach when you're quieing for a rollercoaster.

I'm still yet to figure out what exact combination of factors bring on this mood, it's often at night when I'm being antisocial, althought occasionally I've experienced it elsewhere but rarely with others.

Writing seems to help, I guess it's easy enough to do that it is'nt hamstrung by my almost inherent laziness at this hour of the day.

Although, as I slowly begin to feel myself running out of things to say about this topic I feel an anxiety creeping back, a worry that I won't be able to find another task and will be left with the feeling, the wrestless energy.


I wonder, if it is worth writing this into the void, I know a few people who might read it, I'm sure they might be interested to learn something I've never really expressed, I wonder again if they might offer a solution.
