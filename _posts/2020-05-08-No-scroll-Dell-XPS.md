I just ran into this, and it took me an uncomfortably large amount of time to track down, so to try and save others the time, thought I'd write the relatively simple fix.

If you've just wiped your new Dell XPS and now can't scroll or use touchpad gestures then simply go grab the [Dell SupportAssist](https://www.dell.com/support/contents/en-ai/article/product-support/self-support-knowledgebase/software-and-downloads/supportassist) and get it to install the Intell Serial IO Driver.
