# Intro

I was messing around in a Discord server with a few friends waiting for someone to join us when I started doing something I've done a few times.

Having sufficiently pinged my friend to death on most platforms I picked up and did one of the most reliable things you can do when you want to get into contact with someone urgently.

I called him.

And then I had an idea I couldn't really shake, why not build that into discord? Having then announced my intentions and my confidence that I could complete this project to everyone into the call I promptly abandoned my plans and spent 2 hours looking at different javascript and python libraries.

Turns out this was harder than I'd hoped.
